# Agile Weave

Agile Weave is an multi-agent-driven LLM application that transforms your feature requirements into actionable user stories, comprehensive test plans, and automated tests. It leverages AI agents to streamline the software development lifecycle.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– Intelligent Business Analyst Agent
  - Generates well-scoped user stories
  - Creates GHERKIN format acceptance criteria
  - Supports iterative refinement with PM feedback
  
- ðŸ§ª Software Tester Agent
  - Produces comprehensive test plans
  - Covers positive, negative, and corner cases
  - Organizes tests in functional suites
  - Focuses on API-first (shift-left) testing approach

- ðŸ”„ Automation Agent (Work in Progress)
  - Automated test script generation
  - CI/CD pipeline integration
  - Test execution and reporting

- ðŸ“š RAG-enhanced Context
  - Uses retrieval-augmented generation for domain knowledge
  - Supports various data sources including Metabase documentation
  - Vector store-based similarity search

## Usage

### Library Usage

1. Business Analyst Agent
```python
from agents.business_analyst import BusinessAnalystAgent

ba_agent = BusinessAnalystAgent(llm=your_llm, company="YourCompany")
stories = ba_agent.generate_stories(feature_request, context)
refined_stories = ba_agent.refine(stories, feedback)
```

2. Software Tester Agent
```python
from agents.software_tester import SoftwareTesterAgent

test_agent = SoftwareTesterAgent(llm=your_llm, company="YourCompany")
test_plan = test_agent.generate_testplan(user_stories, context)
refined_plan = test_agent.refine(test_plan, feedback)
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the application
```bash
chainlit run app.py
```

2. The application would automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`


### About LLM Application
Agile Weave demonstrates the power of LLM to streamline software development by using Metabase, an open-source data analytics platform, as a practical example. We leverage its documentation and feature set to show:

1. Build RAG-enhanced context from Metabase's documentation
2. Generate user stories for new Metabase features using natural language
3. Create comprehensive test plans that align with Metabase's architecture
4. (WIP) Automate creation of tests in UI E2E and Robot.

The following demo showcases Agile Weave processing a feature request to implement a currency builder function in Metabase, which combines amount and currency code into a formatted currency value.
